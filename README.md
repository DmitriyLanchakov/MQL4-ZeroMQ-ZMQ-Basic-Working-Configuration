# MQL4-ZeroMQ-ZMQ-Basic-Working-Configuration
Basic working configuration of ZeroMQ with Darwinex Metatrader 4 Platform ; Darwinex MT4 ZMQ

The Zip file contains all the structure that might be copied in the MQL4 directory of your installation of Metatrader 4.

Then in Metaeditor, open the mql4zmq.mq4 file and compile it, and then it should be seen in the MT4 terminal in the Experts section, then attach it to a live financial security and check the magics that happens in the live Experts logs.

This should work on all Metatrader 4 platform, even if this describes a procedure that has been made for Darwinex MT4 platform.
